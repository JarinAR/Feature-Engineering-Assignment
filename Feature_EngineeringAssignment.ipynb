Key Parameters of train_test_split(): X: The feature data (independent variables). y: The target data (dependent variable). test_size: The proportion of the data to be used for testing. For example, test_size=0.2 means 20% of the data will be used for testing. random_state: A random seed to ensure reproducibility of the results. It ensures that the same split is obtained each time the code is run. train_size: The proportion of the data to be used for training (if not specified, it’s set automatically based on test_size).\n",
